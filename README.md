# Привет! 你好！Hi! ✌🏼

I'm Jasmine! (or Жасмина, or 茉莉). For over 12 years, I've been a professional in mid-senior management roles working for various creative organisations. But! But! BUT...!!! It's time to dip my fingers into some very techie (but really, not so very different) pies! 🥧

### Embracing my Hackerman! 🚀

I am (overly) excited to embark on a journey to become a top-notch software developer, crafting the cleanest, most elegant code my brain can spit out! 💻

You know what fuels my passion? The unending quest for knowledge and adventure! I'm coming to the end of my time with the brilliant folks at Northcoders, where I've been honing my skills and gaining invaluable expertise. Once I'm done, I can't wait to dive deep into the realms of C#, C++, and even explore the captivating world of Unreal Engine 5. 🎮 

Of course, in true hyperfixation fashion, I'm always open to exploring other fascinating tech realms that catch my fancy too... 

Over summer, I will be dedicating time to the extension of my repositories and projects (and making things that I really love!!!) If you have any ideas, suggestions, or simply want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out. 🌟

### if I was a js file, at least one page would look something like this:


```js
let jasmineBertie = {
  codeUsed: ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS", "SQL", "TypeScript"],
  currentSelfStudy: ["C++", "C#", "Unreal Engine 5"],
  tools: [
    "React",
    "ReactNative",
    "Node.js",
    "Jest",
    "PostgreSQL",
    "VisualStudioCode",
  ],
  practices: [
    "Agile(kanban, scrum)",
    "VersionControl(git)",
    "Accessibility(implementation of best practices for inclusivity)",
  ],
  location: "Liverpool UK",
  postCodeWindDown: ["Gaming", "Anime", "Learning Chinese 🇨🇳"],
};

function UpdateCurrentLikes(summer) {
  jasmine.postCodeWindDown.push(`wild swimming 🏊🏼‍♀️`);
  jasmine.postCodeWindDown.push(`fixie riding around Liverpool`);
  jasmine.postCodeWindDown[0] = `Shenmue 3`;
}

function addNewHyperfixation() {
  jasmine.dreamJobs = [`Game Developer`, `Game QA Tester`] ;
}

UpdateCurrentLikes(summer);
addNewHyperfixation();
console.log(jasmine);
```
